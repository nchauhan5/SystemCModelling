# SystemC Modeling

In this project I created a performant embedded systems model for Image processing in a System level description language, the IEEE SystemC that automatically detects edges in a digital camera. For my application, I used a purely sequential, multi-stage C code for Canny Edge Algorithm that detects a wide range of edges in grey-scale images. I removed costly dynamic memory allocation and migrated it to C++ compliant code. Later I took each sequential stage of Canny algorithm as a separate module in System C model and following a top down design approach introduced pipelining, parallelization and compiler optimizations to achieve a much better simulated throughput (frames per second) for a real time recording drone camera.
