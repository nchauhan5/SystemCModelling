# SystemC Modeling

In this project we created a performant embedded systems model for Image processing in a System level description language, the IEEE SystemC that automatically detects edges in a digital camera. For our application, we used a purely sequential, multi-stage C code for Canny Edge Algorithm that detects a wide range of edges in grey-scale images. We removed costly dynamic memory allocation and migrated it to C++ compliant code. Later we took each sequential stage of Canny algorithm as a separate module in System C model and following a top down design approach introduced pipelining, parallelization and compiler optimizations to achieve a much better simulated throughput (frames per second) for our real time recording drone camera.
